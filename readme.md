## DESIGN
For this project I focused on creating custom CSS and implementing a user interface that was easy to navigate and use. The design of this application was was guided by the user stories.

**USER STORIES**

* As a user I want to be able to create a new to-do
* As a user I want to be able to update my to-dos
* As a user I want to be able to delete individual to-dos
* As a user I want to be able to view all of my to-dos
