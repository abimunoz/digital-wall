## OVERVIEW
This is the first web app that I created. It began as a very basic to-do app that incorporated the four basic functions of [persistent storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete): create, read, update, and delete. After completing the to-to app successfully, the project continued to evolved, now it renders text as well as a variety of media from a single input.

## DESIGN

**USER STORIES**

Digital Wall user stories
* As a user I want to be able to embed multimedia
* As a user I want to be able to update text
* As a user I want to be able to delete individual posts
* As a user I want to be able to view all of the content that has been posted

To-do user stories
* As a user I want to be able to create a new to-do
* As a user I want to be able to update my to-dos
* As a user I want to be able to delete individual to-dos
* As a user I want to be able to view all of my to-dos
